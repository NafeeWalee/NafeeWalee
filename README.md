### Hi there, Walee is here... 👋

[![](https://github.com/NafeeWalee/NafeeWalee/blob/master/dartSide.gif)](#)

🚀 **A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…** *(March 18, 2020)*  
I was faced with a difficult choice: **React Native** or **Flutter**.  
After a long council meeting, I embraced the **Dart Side**. 🌌  
From native Android (Java) to cross-platform Flutter apps,  
the **force** has grown stronger ever since. 💙
