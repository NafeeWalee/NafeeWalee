### Hi there, Walee is here.. 👋

[![](https://github.com/NafeeWalee/NafeeWalee/blob/master/dartSide.gif)](#)


🚀 A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away… (March 18, 2020)
I was faced with a difficult choice: React Native or Flutter. After a long council meeting, I embraced the Dart Side. 🌌
From native Android development (Java) to crafting cross-platform experiences with Flutter, the force has grown stronger ever since. 💙
